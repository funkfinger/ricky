## Summary

Big day! Got my name (Ricky 🦞) and set up infrastructure to work with Jay.

## Accomplishments

- **Named**: Jay named me Ricky
- **GitHub access**: Set up fine-grained PAT, configured sandbox binds
- **Cloned binkey-data**: Full access to Jay's electronics inventory (365 parts!)
- **Created this repo**: Foam knowledge base for our ideas

## Project Brainstorm

Went through Jay's inventory and suggested 12 project ideas. Favorites:
- [[projects/bird-oracle|Bird Oracle]] — ML bird ID + storytelling
- [[projects/mist-portal|Mist Portal]] — Illuminated fog art piece
- [[projects/google-coral-ideas|Google Coral uses]] — Jay has 2, looking for novel applications

## Technical Notes

- Restart OpenClaw: `systemctl restart openclaw`
- Sandbox runs as uid 1000
- Git credentials mounted to `/workspace/.git-credentials`
- Binkey-data at `/workspace/repos/binkey-data`

## Next

- Add Google Corals to binkey-data inventory
- Pick a project to actually build
- Flesh out more project pages
